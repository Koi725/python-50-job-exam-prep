# python-50-job-prep

A curated set of **50 foundational Python problems** designed for job preparation and sharpening core programming skills.  
The focus is on **clean, professional, framework-free** solutions with clear comments, readable structure, and simple tests.

## Why this repo?

- Build strong fundamentals that frequently appear in interviews.
- Practice robust coding habits: input validation, pure functions, and separation of concerns.
- Keep it simple: **no frameworks, no third-party packages**â€”just the Python standard library.

## Goals

- Professional code style with meaningful naming and inline comments (English).
- Each problem lives in its own file and includes a small `main()` for CLI usage.
- Optional unit tests for each problem using the standard `unittest` module.
